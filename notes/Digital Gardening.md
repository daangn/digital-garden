- [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
  - Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **[[Digital Gardening]]**.
  - Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
  - A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.
  - They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.
  - They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
  - They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.
  - The notion of a **[[Digital Garden]]** is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades.
  - Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html) appears to be the first recorded mention of the term.
  - > Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes
  - At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on
  - [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://youtu.be/ckv_CjyKyZY). It later becomes [a hefty essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. **If anyone should be considered the original source of **[[Digital Gardening]]**, it's Caufield.** They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.
  - Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.
  - > "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."
  - Many of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon were part of communities like...
    - The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) collective – a group that has been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a decade.
    - Users of the note-taking app [[Roam Research]] – Roam pioneered new ways of interlinking content and strongly appeals to people trying to build sprawling knowledge graphs.
    - Followers of Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)([[Second Brain]]) course which popularised the idea of actively curating personal knowledge.
    - People rallying around the [[Learn in Public]] ethos that encourages continuously creating 'learning exhaust' in the form of notes and summaries.
  - Tools like [[Obsidian]], [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), and [[Notion]] are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, bi-directional links, footnotes, and visual graphs.
  - However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the [[IA]] and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count," as "real" gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.
  - The Six Patterns of Gardening
    - 1. Topography over Timelines
    - 2. Continuous Growth
    - 3. Imperfection & [[Learn in Public]]
    - 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental
    - 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity
    - 6. Independent Ownership
